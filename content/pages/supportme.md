## Go Above and Beyond

There are several ways you can support my content, the easiest is just to watch and hit that thumbs up button on the video's and maybe share them around.
But let's be honest my family struggles just to pay the bills each month so any financial support is also very welcomed, not mandatory mind you but very appreciated.
To that end there are a couple ways you can support the channel and in-turn help me dedicate more time to creating more content. In Turn for your support you do get a couple perks
- Special Discord roles and access to supporter only channels
- Game server access which I record on
- Members only posts/polls/images/behind the scenes videos ( YT Memberships only)
- my undying gratitude

### <img src="/images/patreon.png"  alt="patreon" style="max-width:20px" /> Patreon Membership
Patreon has been a staple for most content creators since its inception and I do keep a patreon page with the same pricing and mostly the same perks as with YouTube Memberships, I keep this around for people that have problems with YouTube Memberships I may look into another solution in the future.
- Cryptic Supporter $1.00
- Cryptic Fan $2.00
